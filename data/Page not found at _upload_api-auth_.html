  Page not found (404)

Request Method: 	GET
Request URL: 	http://127.0.0.1:8000/upload/api-auth/

Using the URLconf defined in |myjangostartup.urls|, Django tried these
URL patterns, in this order:

 1. ^admin/
 2. ^polls/
 3. ^upload/ ^$ [name='index']
 4. ^upload/ ^done/$ [name='done']
 5. ^upload/ ^reindex/$ [name='reindex']
 6. ^upload/ ^(?P<document_id>attachments/\w+\.pdf)/$ [name='view']
 7. ^dictionary/
 8. ^api-auth/

The current URL, |upload/api-auth/|, didn't match any of these.

You're seeing this error because you have |DEBUG = True| in your Django
settings file. Change that to |False|, and Django will display a
standard 404 page.
